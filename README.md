# Intelligence of Seeing: Socratic Spiral

**A multi-agent Socratic reasoning framework for navigating AI ambiguity.**

Inspired by the theories of **Rudolf Arnheim** (Visual Thinking) and **David Bohm** (Wholeness and Dialogue), this project implements a "Proprioceptive" logic loop to refine Large Language Model outputs and identify structural hallucinations.

## 👁️ The Vision
As a designer transitioning into AI Product Design, I am exploring how we can move AI from simple "Next-Token Prediction" to a state of **Structural Proprioception**—where the system possesses an internal, self-monitoring awareness of its own reasoning process.

## 🧠 The Architecture (v1.2)
This system replaces the "Black Box" of a single AI prompt with a dynamic, multi-agent loop:

* **The Advocate:** Explores the "Long Tails" of creative and lateral possibility.
* **The Skeptic:** A "Red Team" agent that identifies Typicality Bias and logical slips.
* **The Scribe:** Acts as the "Adult in the Room" to arbitrate friction and find coherence.
* **The Presenter:** A human-centered interface that translates dense machine logic into accessible, visual design insights.

## 🚀 Key Discovery: The Circularity Paradox
During the development of **v1.1**, this system identified a fundamental hurdle: AI self-monitoring often fails because it relies on the same internal model it is trying to correct. Version **v1.2** introduces the "Presenter" agent specifically to bridge this gap between machine "feeling" and human "seeing."

# 📂 Project Milestones: The Externalized Mind

This folder tracks the evolution of the **Intelligence of Seeing** from a technical experiment into an **Externalized Cognitive Sandbox.**

### **The "Catalyst for the Curious" Philosophy**
Most AI tools function as "Vending Machines" (Input -> Output). This project transforms the LLM into a "Studio" (Input -> Dialogue -> Refined Insight). We are manifesting the internal Socratic dialogue—the silent debate between intuition and rigor—and making it visible through agentic orchestration.

### **The Proprioceptive Bridge: Body, Mind, & Machine**

**The Concept:** 
The core innovation of this project is the application of **Proprioception** (the internal sense of one's own state) to the reasoning process. Intelligence requires Proprioception—an internal sense of one’s own state. Without it, a body cannot balance, a mind cannot reason without bias, and an AI cannot avoid "Typicality."

**The Lineage:**
1.  **Somatic (Irene Dowd):** Proprioception as the "internal eye" of the body. In this project, we treat **Reasoning** as a movement that requires microscopic "neuromuscular" correction to stay balanced.
2.  **Quantum (David Bohm):** The "Proprioception of Thought." By externalizing our thinking into a multi-agent dialogue, we gain the ability to "feel" the movement of our own logic, catching biases and typicality before they settle.
3.  **Agentic (v1.2):** We implement this via the **Advocate, Skeptic, and Scribe** loop. This creates "Digital Proprioception," where the system audits its own trajectory toward **Discovery** rather than just **Retrieval.**

**The Mirror Effect:** The machine acts as a "Catalyst for the Curious". It doesn't replace your intuition; it provides the "resistance" necessary for your own creative genesis to become visible.

### **Key Breakthroughs**
* **v1.1: The Socratic Foundation:** Initial proof of the three-agent loop. Identified the "Circularity Paradox."
* **v1.2: The Spokesperson Update:** Introduced the **Universal Presenter** with "Strategic Advisor" mode to bridge the gap between machine logic and human design strategy.


## 📂 Project Evolution: The Externalized Mind
This project is an iterative journey from a technical experiment to an **Externalized Cognitive Sandbox.** You can find the "Sedimentary Record" of every breakthrough—including the code for the Circularity Paradox and the v1.2 Spokesperson update—in the [Milestones Folder](./milestones).
