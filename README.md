# Intelligence of Seeing: Socratic Spiral

**A multi-agent Socratic reasoning framework for navigating AI ambiguity.**

Inspired by the theories of **Rudolf Arnheim** (Visual Thinking) and **David Bohm** (Wholeness and Dialogue), this project implements a "Proprioceptive" logic loop to refine Large Language Model outputs and identify structural hallucinations.

## 👁️ The Vision
As a designer transitioning into AI Product Design, I am exploring how we can move AI from simple "Next-Token Prediction" to a state of **Structural Proprioception**—where the system possesses an internal, self-monitoring awareness of its own reasoning process.

## 🧠 The Architecture (v1.2)
This system replaces the "Black Box" of a single AI prompt with a dynamic, multi-agent loop:

* **The Advocate:** Explores the "Long Tails" of creative and lateral possibility.
* **The Skeptic:** A "Red Team" agent that identifies Typicality Bias and logical slips.
* **The Scribe:** Acts as the "Adult in the Room" to arbitrate friction and find coherence.
* **The Presenter:** A human-centered interface that translates dense machine logic into accessible, visual design insights.

## 🚀 Key Discovery: The Circularity Paradox
During the development of **v1.1**, this system identified a fundamental hurdle: AI self-monitoring often fails because it relies on the same internal model it is trying to correct. Version **v1.2** introduces the "Presenter" agent specifically to bridge this gap between machine "feeling" and human "seeing."
